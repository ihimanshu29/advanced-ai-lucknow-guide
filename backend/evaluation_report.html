      <td>[Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula: The Benevolent Builder\nAsaf-ud-Daula (ruled 1775â€“1797) is one of the most remembered figures in Lucknow's history, primarily for his generosity and his architectural contributions. During a severe famine in the 1780s, he initiated a food-for-work program by commissioning the construction of two magnificent structures to provide employment to his people. This led to the famous saying, "Jisko na de Maula, usko de Asaf-ud-Daula" (To whom God does not give, Asaf-ud-Daula gives).\n\n- Bara Imambara: Built in 1784, the Bara Imambara ("big shrine") is one of Lucknow's most famous monuments. Its central arched hall is a marvel of engineering, measuring 50 by 16 meters and over 15 meters tall, and is one of the largest vaulted constructions in the world to stand without any pillars or beams for support. The complex also includes the grand Asfi Mosque and the Bhul-bhulaiya, an intricate three-dimensional labyrinth with over 1,000 passages., - Rumi Darwaza: This imposing gateway, standing sixty feet tall, was also built under Asaf-ud-Daula's patronage around 1784. It is an exquisite example of Awadhi architecture and is often called the Turkish Gate because it was modeled after the Sublime Porte (Bab-iHÃ¼mayun) in Istanbul., A Glimpse into the History of Lucknow: The City of Nawabs\n\nLucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, is a city steeped in history, culture, and architectural grandeur. Its golden age began in the 18th century when it became the capital of the Nawabs of Awadh, who were patrons of art, music, and architecture. Their reign left an indelible mark on the city, earning it the moniker "The Constantinople of the East."\n\nThe Rise of the Nawabs of Awadh:\nThe decline of the Mughal Empire led to the rise of several independent states, including Awadh. The Nawabs, originally governors appointed by the Mughal emperor, established their own dynasty. In 1775, the fourth Nawab, Asaf-ud-Daula, shifted the capital from Faizabad to Lucknow, ushering in an era of unprecedented prosperity and cultural development., - Galouti Kebab: The "Galouti" kebab, meaning "melt in the mouth," was specifically created for an aging, toothless Nawab of Awadh, who couldn't enjoy his favorite meat dishes anymore. It is made from finely minced mutton or lamb that is tenderized with raw papaya and then blended with a secret mix of over 100 spices before being shallow-fried.\n\n- Seekh Kebab: While available elsewhere, the Lucknowi Seekh Kebab is a class apart. Minced meat, seasoned with ginger, garlic, and a host of spices, is wrapped around a skewer (seekh) and cooked over charcoal fires. The smoky aroma and the juicy texture make it a perennial favorite.\n\nBeyond Kebabs:\nWhile kebabs are the stars, Lucknow's culinary scene offers much more.]</td>
